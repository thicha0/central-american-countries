Furthermore, the remains of this civilization display its greatness and we can still be fascinated by their beliefs, their societies and their knowlegde (especially in the mathematical and astronomical fields). The Tikal was home to an ancient Mayan city and we can now only contemplate the foundation of their community. This site is well-known for its temples (see the picture) but is also composed of causeways, a great place and acropolis.",
